## 🚧 WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE

### 1. External Services Configuration (CRITICAL - 1-2 hours)

#### Cloudflare R2 Setup
**Status:** Not configured  
**Required for:** Photo/video uploads

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at https://cloudflare.com
2. Navigate to R2 Object Storage
3. Create bucket: `smasher-media`
4. Generate API token with R2 permissions
5. Configure CORS policy:
   ```json
   [
     {
       "AllowedOrigins": ["*"],
       "AllowedMethods": ["GET", "PUT", "POST"],
       "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
       "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
     }
   ]
   ```
6. Add credentials to server `.env`:
   ```
   R2_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
   R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
   R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
   R2_BUCKET_NAME=smasher-media
   R2_PUBLIC_URL=https://your-bucket.r2.cloudflarestorage.com
   ```

**Cost:** Free tier: 10GB storage, 1M Class A operations/month

#### Resend Email Setup
**Status:** Not configured  
**Required for:** Email verification codes

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at https://resend.com
2. Get API key
3. (Optional) Verify custom domain OR use resend.dev for testing
4. Add to server `.env`:
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key
   RESEND_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com
   ```

**Cost:** Free tier: 3,000 emails/month

---

### 2. Backend Deployment (CRITICAL - 2-3 hours)

**Status:** Not deployed  
**Current:** API URL in app points to `https://smasher-api.fly.dev` (not yet created)

**Steps:**
1. Install Fly.io CLI: `powershell -c "iwr https://fly.io/install.ps1 -useb | iex"`
2. Login: `fly auth login`
3. Deploy:
   ```powershell
   cd server
   fly launch --name smasher-api
   fly secrets set DATABASE_URL="..." JWT_SECRET="..." RESEND_API_KEY="..." R2_ACCOUNT_ID="..." R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..." R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..." R2_BUCKET_NAME="smasher-media"
   fly deploy
   ```
4. Run migrations: `fly ssh console -C "npm run migration:run"`
5. Test health endpoint: `curl https://smasher-api.fly.dev/health`

**Cost:** ~$10-30/month (includes PostgreSQL database)

---

### 3. Release Build Configuration (REQUIRED - 30 minutes)

**Status:** Debug keystore exists, release keystore NOT created

#### Generate Release Keystore
```powershell
cd app-rn\android\app
keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore smasher-release-key.keystore -alias smasher-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Save keystore password securely! If lost, you can never update the app.

#### Configure Signing
Create `app-rn\android\gradle.properties`:
```properties
SMASHER_UPLOAD_STORE_FILE=smasher-release-key.keystore
SMASHER_UPLOAD_STORE_PASSWORD=your_keystore_password
SMASHER_UPLOAD_KEY_ALIAS=smasher-key-alias
SMASHER_UPLOAD_KEY_PASSWORD=your_key_password
```

**⚠️ Add to .gitignore** - Never commit passwords!

#### Build Release AAB
```powershell
cd app-rn\android
.\gradlew clean
.\gradlew bundleRelease
```

Output: `app-rn\android\app\build\outputs\bundle\release\app-release.aab`
