Update the version number and code before rebuilding the app every time.
Use guaranteed sure-fire fixes every time instead of possible fixes or trial and error fixes.
You can run logs if they are needed just make sure to incorporate a timeout or some kind of endpoint for yourself to stop them after 15-30 seconds because you get stuck every time you run them.
If you run a command and it takes longer than 30 seconds to complete, then stop the command and try again.
