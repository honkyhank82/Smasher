DELETE /users/push-token             - Remove push token
```

### Dependencies Installed
- ‚úÖ `@nestjs/schedule` - Cron jobs
- ‚úÖ `expo-server-sdk` - Push notifications

### Database Schema

**location_shares table:**
- id (UUID, primary key)
- userId (UUID, indexed)
- sharedWithUserId (UUID, indexed)
- latitude (decimal 10,8)
- longitude (decimal 11,8)
- expiresAt (timestamp, indexed)
- isActive (boolean, indexed)
- createdAt, updatedAt

**notifications table:**
- id (UUID, primary key)
- userId (UUID, indexed)
- type (varchar)
- title (varchar)
- body (text)
- data (jsonb)
- read (boolean, indexed)
- createdAt

**users table (updated):**
- Added: pushToken (varchar, nullable)

## üîî Push Notifications

### Notification Types
1. **location_share_started** - When someone shares with you
2. **location_share_stopped** - When sharing ends manually
3. **location_share_expired** - When sharing expires automatically

### Features
- ‚úÖ Automatic registration on login
- ‚úÖ Token removal on logout
- ‚úÖ Real-time delivery
- ‚úÖ Tap to open location
- ‚úÖ Badge count management

## ‚öôÔ∏è Auto-Cleanup

**Cron Job** (runs every 5 minutes):
- Finds expired shares
- Marks as inactive
- Sends expiry notifications
- Logs cleanup count

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Authorization
- ‚úÖ JWT authentication required
- ‚úÖ Users can only stop their own shares
- ‚úÖ Users can only view shares they're involved in
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting via Throttler

### Privacy Features
- ‚úÖ Location only shared with selected user
- ‚úÖ Automatic expiration
- ‚úÖ Manual cancellation anytime
- ‚úÖ Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS)
- ‚úÖ No permanent location history

## üì± User Flow

### Sharing Your Location
1. Navigate to user profile
2. Tap "Share Location" button
3. Select duration (15min - 24hrs)
4. Location sharing starts
5. Real-time updates begin
6. Recipient gets push notification

### Viewing Shared Location
1. Receive push notification
2. Tap to open map
3. See real-time location
4. View distance and time remaining
5. Auto-refresh every 10s

### Stopping Share
1. Open location share screen
2. Tap "Stop" on active share
3. Sharing ends immediately
4. Recipient gets notification

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Backend
1. Deploy to Fly.io:
   ```bash
   cd server
   fly deploy
   ```

2. Database will auto-migrate with TypeORM synchronize

### Frontend
1. Update app.json with notification permissions (already done)
2. Build new version:
   ```bash
   cd app-rn
   npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile production
   ```

3. Or push OTA update:
   ```bash
   npx eas-cli update --branch production --message "Location sharing with notifications"
   ```

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Frontend
- [ ] Start location share
- [ ] Select different durations
- [ ] View real-time updates on map
- [ ] Test distance calculation
- [ ] Test center buttons
- [ ] Stop share manually
- [ ] Test auto-expiry
- [ ] Test push notifications
- [ ] Test multiple active shares

### Backend
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly
- [ ] Location updates save properly
- [ ] Cron job expires old shares
- [ ] Push notifications send
- [ ] Authorization works
- [ ] Database indexes perform well

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Frontend
- Location updates: Every 10s or 10m movement
- Map refresh: Every 10s
- Minimal battery impact with optimized tracking

### Backend
- Indexed queries for fast lookups
- Cron job every 5 minutes (not resource-intensive)
- Push notifications batched via Expo

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Location history/breadcrumbs
- [ ] Geofencing alerts ("User arrived")
- [ ] Share with multiple users
- [ ] Custom share messages
- [ ] Location accuracy indicator
- [ ] Battery-saving mode
- [ ] Offline support

## üìù Notes

- **TypeORM synchronize** is enabled - will auto-create tables
- **Push tokens** saved on login, removed on logout
- **Cleanup job** prevents database bloat
- **All notifications** stored for history
- **Maps** use Google Maps on Android

## üéâ Status: READY TO DEPLOY

All code is complete and committed. Ready for:
1. Backend deployment
2. Frontend build/OTA update
3. Testing with real users
