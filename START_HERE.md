# 🚀 START HERE - SMASHER Multi-Server Setup

## Welcome! 👋

You've received a complete multi-server setup with automatic failover and a web frontend. This guide will help you get started in minutes.

---

## What You Got

### 1. Web App ✅
A brand new React web app with the same features as your mobile app:
- User authentication
- User discovery
- Real-time chat
- Profile management
- Automatic server failover

**Location**: `d:\Dev\smasher\app-web`

### 2. Multi-Server Failover ✅
Your backend automatically switches between 2 servers if one goes down:
1. Fly.io (Primary) - Your main server
2. Render (Secondary) - Automatic backup

**Zero downtime. Users don't notice.**

### 3. Shared Database ✅
All servers use the same PostgreSQL database:
- No data sync needed
- Instant failover
- Always in sync

### 4. Deployment Tools ✅
Two easy-to-use scripts:
- `setup-all.ps1` - One-time setup
- `deploy-all-servers.ps1` - Deploy to all servers at once
