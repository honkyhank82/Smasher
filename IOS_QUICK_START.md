## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### 1. Push Notifications

Configure APNs key:
```bash
eas credentials
# Select: Push Notifications Key
```

### 2. Background Location

Apple requires explanation for "Always" location permission.

**Add to App Review notes:**
```
SMASHER uses background location to update user's location 
for accurate nearby user matching and real-time distance 
calculations. Users can choose "While Using" instead.
```

### 3. In-App Purchases

Your app uses Stripe. Apple may require:
- Also offer Apple IAP for iOS subscriptions
- Or use Stripe only for web purchases

**Consider implementing:**
```bash
npm install react-native-iap
```

### 4. Content Moderation

Apple requires moderation for user-generated content:
- Add report/block functionality
- Implement photo moderation
- Add terms of service in-app

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "No provisioning profiles found"
```bash
eas credentials
# Select: Set up new credentials
```

### "Build failed"
Check build logs in EAS dashboard for specific error.

### "App rejected by Apple"
Common reasons:
- Missing content moderation
- Background location not justified
- IAP required for subscriptions
- Privacy policy not accessible
