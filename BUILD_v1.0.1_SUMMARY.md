## File Sizes (Approximate)

| File | Size | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| app-release.aab | ~26 MB | Play Store upload |
| app-release.apk | ~100 MB | Direct install/testing |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails with "Unable to delete directory"
**Solution:** Close Android Studio and any file explorers, then retry

### "Keystore not found"
**Solution:** Check `gradle.properties` has correct keystore path

### "Version code already exists"
**Solution:** Increment versionCode to 3 or higher

### Build is slow
**Solution:** Normal for first build, subsequent builds are faster
