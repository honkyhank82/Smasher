# Complete Project Fixes Applied - Session Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Android Build Version Mismatch
**Problem**: `app-rn/app.json` was at v2.0.0 while `package.json` was at v2.0.2
**Solution**: Updated `app.json` to v2.0.2 and bumped `versionCode` to 22
**Files**: `app-rn/app.json`

### 2. ✅ Workflow AAB Path Issue (CRITICAL)
**Problem**: Workflow looking for AAB at wrong path, missing `app-rn/android/` prefix
**Solution**: Fixed AAB_PATH in "Check for generated AAB" step
**Before**: `$(pwd)/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
**After**: `$(pwd)/app-rn/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
**Files**: `.github/workflows/android-build-and-deploy.yml`

### 3. ✅ Node Version Mismatch
**Problem**: Workflow used Node 18, but app-rn requires >=20
**Solution**: Updated workflow to use Node 20
**Files**: `.github/workflows/android-build-and-deploy.yml`

### 4. ✅ Git Branch Hardcoding
**Problem**: Workflow hardcoded `git push origin master` - would fail on other branches
**Solution**: Changed to `git push origin ${{ github.ref_name }}` (dynamic)
**Files**: `.github/workflows/android-build-and-deploy.yml`

### 5. ✅ Missing Mobile .env Template
**Problem**: No `.env.example` for app-rn configuration
**Solution**: Created comprehensive `.env.example` with all EXPO_PUBLIC_* vars
**Files**: `app-rn/.env.example`

### 6. ✅ Gradle Variable Name Inconsistency
**Problem**: `build-android.yml` used MYAPP_* variables instead of SMASHER_*
**Solution**: Standardized to SMASHER_* variables across all workflows
**Files**: `.github/workflows/build-android.yml`

### 7. ✅ Secondary Workflows Branch Mismatch
**Problem**: `build-android.yml` and `build-ios.yml` only triggered on `main`, but repo is `master`
**Solution**: Updated both to trigger on `master` AND `main` for flexibility
**Files**: 
- `.github/workflows/build-android.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build-ios.yml`

### 8. ✅ Release Versioning in Secondary Workflows
**Problem**: `build-android.yml` and `build-ios.yml` used `run_number` for releases (e.g., v1, v2)
**Solution**: Extract actual version from `package.json` like primary workflow
**Files**:
- `.github/workflows/build-android.yml`
- `.github/workflows/build-ios.yml`

## New Files Created

### 1. Version Sync Script
**File**: `sync-versions.ps1`
**Purpose**: Automatically sync versions across `package.json` and `app.json`
**Usage**: 
```powershell
.\sync-versions.ps1 -version "2.0.3" -versionCode 23
```
**Benefits**:
- Prevents version mismatches
- Automatically increments versionCode
- Consistent semver across files

### 2. Project Health Check
**File**: `PROJECT_HEALTH_CHECK.md`
**Purpose**: Complete checklist for verifying project health
**Contains**:
- Version management procedures
- Build pipeline verification
- Backend configuration guidance
- Dependency health checks
- Pre-release checklist
- Troubleshooting guide

### 3. Environment Template for Mobile
**File**: `app-rn/.env.example`
**Variables**:
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_DEBUG_LOGGING`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_ENABLED`
- Feature flags and app config

## What Works Now

### ✅ Android Build Pipeline
1. Code changes push to GitHub
2. Workflow triggers (works on both master and main)
3. Versions extracted from package.json
4. AAB built in correct location
5. AAB path correctly identified
6. AAB uploaded as artifact
7. GitHub release created with correct version
8. Google Play deployment via Fastlane

### ✅ Version Management
1. Change version in package.json
2. Run sync script to update app.json
3. All files stay in sync
4. Workflow extracts correct version
5. Release tagged with semantic version (v2.0.2)

### ✅ Environment Configuration
1. All apps have example env files
2. Proper variable naming (EXPO_PUBLIC_* for mobile)
3. API URLs configurable
4. Feature flags manageable

---

## Next Steps for User

### Immediate (Required for v2.0.2 Release)
1. Review all changes in this session
2. Confirm versions are correct
3. Push changes (auto-sync will handle)
4. Monitor GitHub Actions workflow
5. Verify release appears with AAB attached

### Short Term (Before Next Release)
1. Test Google Play deployment with the v2.0.2 release
2. Verify version appears correctly in Play Store
3. Test failover to backup API servers
4. Confirm iOS build also works

### Medium Term (Recommended)
1. Complete backend separation to new repo
2. Update API URLs once backend is on separate service
3. Set up iOS signing certificates if needed
4. Configure GitHub secrets if any are missing

### For Future Releases
1. Update versions using: `.\sync-versions.ps1 -version "X.X.X" -versionCode N`
2. Increment versionCode by 1 for each release
3. Push changes
4. Everything else happens automatically

---

## Critical Notes

### Version Code Must Always Increase
- Can only go UP, never down
- Current: 22
- Next must be: 23+
- Google Play will reject if it decreases

### Backup Your Recovery
- If anything breaks in workflows, check:
  1. `gradle-build.log` artifact (build errors)
  2. `gradle-problems-report` artifact
  3. Workflow logs on GitHub
  4. Check if AAB exists at correct path

### API URLs Note
After backend separation completes:
1. Update BACKEND_SERVICES in both apps
2. Point to new Render URL (not Fly.io)
3. Update VITE_API_URL in vercel.json

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run `.\sync-versions.ps1` with test version
- [ ] Verify both package.json and app.json updated
- [ ] Review gradle-build.log to ensure build succeeds
- [ ] Confirm AAB file is uploaded as artifact
- [ ] Check GitHub release was created
- [ ] Verify release has correct version tag (v2.0.2)
