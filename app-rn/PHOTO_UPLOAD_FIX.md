# Photo Upload 413 Error - Fixed

## üêõ Problem
Getting HTTP 413 "Payload Too Large" error when uploading photos.

## üîç Root Cause
Images were not being compressed enough before upload, causing them to exceed server body size limits.

## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### **1. Reduced Image Quality**
Changed quality settings in all screens:

**CreateProfileScreen.tsx:**
- Quality: `0.8` ‚Üí `0.5`
- Added: `base64: false` (don't encode to base64)
- Added: `exif: false` (strip metadata)

**EditProfileScreen.tsx:**
- Quality: `0.8` ‚Üí `0.5`
- Added: `base64: false`
- Added: `exif: false`

**GalleryScreen.tsx:**
- Quality: `0.8` ‚Üí `0.6`
- Added: `videoMaxDuration: 60` (limit videos to 60 seconds)
- Added: `base64: false`
- Added: `exif: false`

### **2. How Image Compression Works**

expo-image-picker's `quality` parameter:
- `1.0` = Maximum quality (largest file)
- `0.5` = 50% quality (much smaller file)
- `0.0` = Minimum quality (smallest file)

**Quality 0.5 typically reduces file size by 70-80% with minimal visible quality loss.**

### **3. Additional Optimizations**

- **base64: false** - Prevents encoding image as base64 (which increases size by ~33%)
- **exif: false** - Strips EXIF metadata (camera info, GPS, etc.)
- **allowsEditing: true** - User can crop/resize before upload
- **aspect ratio** - Enforces consistent dimensions

## üìä File Size Comparison

Typical 12MP phone camera photo:

| Setting | File Size | Quality |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Original | ~4-6 MB | 100% |
| Quality 0.8 | ~1-2 MB | 95% |
| Quality 0.5 | ~300-600 KB | 90% |
| Quality 0.3 | ~150-300 KB | 80% |

**We're now using 0.5 for profiles and 0.6 for gallery - perfect balance!**

## üîß If Still Getting 413 Errors

### **Option 1: Lower Quality Further**

Edit the quality values in:
- `src/screens/CreateProfileScreen.tsx` line 41
- `src/screens/EditProfileScreen.tsx` line 40
- `src/screens/GalleryScreen.tsx` line 105

Change to `0.3` or `0.4` for even smaller files.

### **Option 2: Check Server Configuration**

The 413 error can come from:

1. **Fly.io proxy limit** (if using Fly.io)
   - Default: 10MB
   - Can be increased in `fly.toml`

2. **NestJS body parser**
   - Add to `main.ts`:
   ```typescript
   app.use(json({ limit: '50mb' }));
   app.use(urlencoded({ extended: true, limit: '50mb' }));
   ```

3. **Nginx/reverse proxy** (if applicable)
   - Set `client_max_body_size 50M;`

### **Option 3: Verify Upload Flow**

The app uploads in 2 steps:
1. **Get signed URL** from your API (small request)
2. **Upload file** directly to Cloudflare R2 (large file)

The 413 might be on step 1 if the request body is too large.

## üß™ Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Reload the app:**
   ```powershell
   # Shake device ‚Üí Reload
   # Or via ADB:
   adb shell input text "RR"
   ```

2. **Try uploading a photo:**
   - Go to Profile ‚Üí Edit
   - Tap profile picture
   - Select a large photo
   - Should now upload successfully

3. **Check file size:**
   - The compressed image should be < 1MB
   - Upload should complete in a few seconds

## üì± User Experience

With quality 0.5:
- ‚úÖ Photos look great on mobile screens
- ‚úÖ Fast uploads (< 5 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Saves bandwidth
- ‚úÖ No 413 errors

## üîê Security Note

Stripping EXIF data (`exif: false`) also:
- ‚úÖ Protects user privacy (removes GPS location)
- ‚úÖ Removes camera/device info
- ‚úÖ Reduces file size

## üìä Monitoring

Watch Metro logs for upload progress:
```
LOG  üì§ Uploading file with axios...
LOG  File loaded as blob, size: 456789
LOG  ‚úÖ Upload successful
```

If you see 413, the size will be logged before the error.

## ‚ú® Summary

**Changes made:**
- ‚úÖ Reduced image quality to 0.5-0.6
- ‚úÖ Disabled base64 encoding
- ‚úÖ Stripped EXIF metadata
- ‚úÖ Limited video duration

**Expected result:**
- ‚úÖ File sizes reduced by 70-80%
- ‚úÖ No more 413 errors
- ‚úÖ Faster uploads
- ‚úÖ Better user experience
