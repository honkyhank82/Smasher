## üîß iOS-Specific Considerations

### 1. **Background Location**

Your app requests "Always" location permission. Apple requires justification:

**In App Store Review Notes, explain:**
```
SMASHER uses background location to:
1. Update user's location for accurate nearby user matching
2. Show real-time distance to other users
3. Enable location-based features when app is backgrounded

Users can choose "While Using" instead of "Always" - the app works with both.
```

### 2. **Push Notifications**

Configure APNs (Apple Push Notification service):

```bash
eas credentials
```

Select:
- **Push Notifications Key**
- EAS will generate and upload automatically

### 3. **In-App Purchases (Stripe)**

Your app uses Stripe for Premium subscriptions. Apple requires:

1. **Alternative:** Also offer IAP (In-App Purchase) for iOS
2. **Or:** Use Stripe only for web purchases, not in-app

**Recommended approach:**
- Use Apple IAP for iOS subscriptions
- Keep Stripe for web/Android

**Implementation needed:**
```bash
npm install react-native-iap
```

Then implement Apple IAP alongside Stripe.

### 4. **App Store Guidelines Compliance**

‚úÖ **Your app complies with:**
- 4.3 - Spam: Unique social networking app
- 1.1 - Safety: User-generated content moderation needed
- 2.1 - Performance: Native React Native app
- 5.1.1 - Privacy: All permissions explained

‚ö†Ô∏è **Action required:**
- Implement content moderation for user photos/messages
- Add report/block functionality
- Add terms of service & privacy policy links in app
