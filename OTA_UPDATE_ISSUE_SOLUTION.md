# OTA Update Issue - Not Reaching Google Play App

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Issue:** OTA updates not applying to app installed from Google Play

## Problem Diagnosis

### Why OTA Updates Aren't Working

**Root Cause:** The app on Google Play was built with an **older runtime version** (likely 1.0.2 or earlier) BEFORE the recent changes were made.

**How OTA Updates Work:**
- OTA updates only apply to apps with **matching runtime versions**
- Your current OTA updates are for runtime version **1.0.3**
- The app on Google Play has an older runtime version
- **Result:** Updates are ignored because runtime versions don't match

### What's Different

**App on Google Play (Old):**
- Runtime version: 1.0.2 or earlier
- Mock data: Gender-neutral names (Alex, Jordan, Sam, Taylor, etc.)
- Layout: Vertical list view
- Columns: 1 (list)

**OTA Updates Published (New):**
- Runtime version: 1.0.3
- Mock data: Male names (Marcus, Jake, Brandon, Tyler, etc.)
- Layout: Grid view
- Columns: 4

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Build New Version for Google Play ‚úÖ (RECOMMENDED)

A new build has been started with all the latest changes. This will create a new AAB file that you can submit to Google Play.

**Build Command Running:**
```bash
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile production
```

**Steps After Build Completes:**

1. **Download the AAB file** from EAS Build dashboard
2. **Upload to Google Play Console**
   - Go to: https://play.google.com/console
   - Navigate to: Production ‚Üí Create new release
   - Upload the new AAB file
3. **Submit for Review**
   - Add release notes: "Updated UI with grid layout and improved profiles"
   - Submit for review
4. **Wait for Approval** (typically 1-3 days)

### Solution 2: Test Locally Right Now ‚ö°

If you want to see the changes immediately without waiting for Google Play:

**Option A: Build Development APK**
```bash
cd app-rn
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview --local
```

**Option B: Use Expo Go (Development)**
```bash
cd app-rn
npx expo start
```
Then scan QR code with Expo Go app.

### Solution 3: Update Runtime Version Strategy (Future)

To avoid this issue in the future, consider:

1. **Keep same runtime version** for JavaScript-only changes
2. **Only increment runtime version** when:
   - Adding new native modules
   - Changing native configuration
   - Major version updates

**Example:**
- UI changes, mock data ‚Üí Keep runtime 1.0.3 ‚Üí OTA works ‚úÖ
- Add new native library ‚Üí Bump to 1.0.4 ‚Üí Need new build ‚ùå

## What Changed in This Update

### 1. Mock Data
**Before:**
- Alex, Jordan, Sam, Taylor, Morgan, Riley, Casey, Avery

**After:**
- Marcus, Jake, Brandon, Tyler, Derek, Kevin, Ryan, Nathan, Connor, Ethan, Logan, Austin

### 2. Layout
**Before:**
- Vertical list
- 1 profile per row
- Horizontal cards
- Small images (80x80)

**After:**
- Grid layout
- 4 profiles per row
- 3 rows visible

## Timeline

### Current Status

1. ‚úÖ **OTA Updates Published** (3 updates)
   - Update 1: Backend fixes
   - Update 2: Male profiles + 2-column grid
   - Update 3: 4-column grid + 12 profiles

2. üîÑ **New Build In Progress**
   - Platform: Android
   - Profile: Production
   - Type: AAB (for Google Play)
   - Status: Building...

3. ‚è≥ **Next Steps**
   - Wait for build to complete (~15-30 minutes)
   - Download AAB file
   - Upload to Google Play Console
   - Submit for review
   - Wait for approval (1-3 days)

## Testing the Changes

### Immediate Testing (Before Google Play)

**Method 1: Build Preview APK**
```bash
cd app-rn
npx eas-cli build --platform android --profile preview
```
This creates an APK you can install immediately.

**Method 2: Development Build**
```bash
cd app-rn
npx expo start
```
Use Expo Go or development build to test.

### After Google Play Approval

Once the new version is live on Google Play:
1. Users update the app from Play Store
2. App now has runtime version 1.0.3
3. Future OTA updates will work automatically
4. No more Play Store submissions needed for JS changes

## Key Learnings

### OTA Updates Limitations

**What OTA Can Update:**
- ‚úÖ JavaScript code
- ‚úÖ React components
- ‚úÖ Styles and layouts
- ‚úÖ Mock data
- ‚úÖ Business logic

**What OTA Cannot Update:**
- ‚ùå Native code changes
- ‚ùå New native dependencies
- ‚ùå App configuration (permissions, etc.)
- ‚ùå Different runtime versions

### Best Practices

1. **Plan Runtime Versions Carefully**
   - Use same version for JS-only changes
   - Increment only when necessary

2. **Test OTA Updates**
   - Always test on matching runtime version
   - Verify updates apply correctly

3. **Document Changes**
   - Track which changes need new builds
   - Track which can use OTA

4. **Communicate with Users**
   - Major changes ‚Üí New app version
   - Minor fixes ‚Üí OTA updates
